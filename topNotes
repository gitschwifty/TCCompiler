bash commands to assemble asm code and link files
nasm -f macho64 {name}.asm
ld {name}.o

current architecture- macho64 x86_64: c -> asm -> object -> executable
should probably eventually run it to a linux architecture if possible. RISC
would honestly be faster than x86_64 but depends on final run choice. could
create an inbetween thing: go from c to non-platform specific lang, then run
to the assembly and machine language for specific platform, to using linker
for the executable

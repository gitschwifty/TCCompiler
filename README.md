# TCCompiler
A C Compiler written in C meant to solidify my understanding of ML, C, compiling, etc. Documented progress at pjtaggart.com
More documentation for the entirety of the compiler will be added as it actually starts compiling things. At this point, I just wanted it up on GitHub.
Any comments or suggestions on code already written is welcome, especially in the ML part since I don't really know ML too well.

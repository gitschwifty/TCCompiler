this file contains a couple of test files I have written to test compilation from c to assembly, then I'll go into executables since that is just an extension of the assembly generation no?

assembly to linker
nasm -f macho64 {name}.asm
ld {name}.o
probably not needed unsure


can also just go
gcc -S {name}.c
gcc {name}.s

get compiler to take the c file into .s file then link idk

/**
*
* mainTest.c
* Main C File for test of returning values from executable
* returns 2;
*
**/
